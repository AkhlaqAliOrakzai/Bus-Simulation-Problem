# Bus-Simulation-Problem
It is developed with JavaFx, Java Swings


This problem is originally based on the Bus at University. Students come to zero point and wait for bus.
When the bus arrive all the waiting students invoked PanelBus. But anyone who arrive while the bus is boarding has to wait for
the next bus. The capacity of the bus is 30 students if there are more than 30 students waiting so remaining students have to 
wait for next bus. When all the waiting students have boarded the bus can invoke depart. If the bus arrive when there are no students
it should depart immediately.

Expected Outcome : 
A bus will arrive at zero point. Students will enter into the bus and the bus will go but the bus will have the capacity to pick
30 students. If there is no bus then students will have to wait for bus. After arriving of the bus students will enter into the bus.
If there is no students then bus will go back immediately.
